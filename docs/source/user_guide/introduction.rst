What are FRBs?
--------------
Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are a class of radio frequency transients that 
currently have an unknown astrophysical origin [1]_. FRB are characterised by 
their large dispersion measures (DMs; :math:`~100 - 2500\ \rm{pc\ cm^{-3}}`) 
and short durations (:math:`30\ \mu \rm{s} - 30\ \rm{ms}`).

For a database of all currently known FRBs see `frbcat.org`_

    has not been detected.
